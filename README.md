[Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/) can help automating repetitive task.
The Flow service already did a really well integration with a variety of applications,
 e.g. send email, send tweet, read Dropbox document and so on. Microsoft Flow can act
 as a broker between your application and those applications. By doing so, it can elevate
 the burden of building integrations with different applications.
